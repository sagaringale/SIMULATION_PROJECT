#### DESCRIPTION:


# Environment: 
		Python 2.7


# Project Description: 
		# IN THIS PROJECT USE SIMULATION METHOD & WORK  
		
		
		- GET DATE VARIABLES NEEDED FOR CALCULATIONS AND OUTPUT TEXT
		
		- GENERATE CORRELATED STANDARD NORMALS USING THE POLAR METHOD, THEN CONVERT TO CORRELATED UNIFORMS
                
		- CREATE CUMULATIVE PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION 0<=F(120-a)<=1 WHERE a IS EXACT AGE
               
                - INVERSE TRANSFORM MAPS 0<=U<=1 TO 0<=H(U)<=(120-a) WHERE a IS EXACT AGE 
		
		- MONTE CARLO SIMULATION OF REMAINING LIFESPAN	
		
		- VISUALIZATIONS FOR DATA
		
		- DISPLAY UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION PLOT [Probability of Death and Life Expectancy]
		
		- DISPLAY SCATTER PLOT [Using Monte Carlo Simulation Result of Remaing Lifespan)

		- SCENARIO 1 (N Premium Payment Sources, 1 Benefit Payment)
